# image-classification-ml
This project uses a special kind of computer program called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and machine learning to understand pictures. We're focusing on a specific collection of images called CIFAR-10. By teaching our program to recognize objects in these pictures, we hope to make computers smarter at understanding what they "see."
# load the datasets
Load the cifar10 dataset in this program
# classifies the images
It identifies the images with labels
